## What I'm passionate about

This personal website initially served as a casual endeavor, where I chronicled my exploration of GitHub repositories that captivated my attention and addressed practical challenges. As I honed my product development expertise, this blog evolved into a repository of my learning experiences. Now, I share my insights, acquired knowledge, and frameworks that fuel my growth and aid in comprehending customer needs while overseeing interdepartmental teams. Inspired by the abundance of freely available open-source content that has enriched my journey, I aspire to reciprocate the knowledge I have gained. ðŸŽ‰
## Hobbies

When not immersed in resolving customer issues, I find contentment in crafting culinary masterpieces or embarking on invigorating mountain hikes. Additionally, I relish the opportunity to expand my horizons through cultural exploration and cross-cultural interactions. My relocation to Germany has rekindled my passion for beer, a beverage that has become my companion during this extraordinary journey. Within the confines of my abode, I embrace the tranquility of podcasts, the transformative power of painting, and the nurturing touch of tending to my flourishing flora. [Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/) stands as my current recommendation for those seeking intellectual stimulation and thought-provoking perspectives.
