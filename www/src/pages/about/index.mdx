## What I'm passionate about

This personal website was made as a hobby project where I blog about different GitHub repositories that pricks my interest and solve real-life problems. I learned so much using free and open-source content that I wanted to contribute back ðŸŽ‰ .

To know more about my work, scroll down. On the fun side, you can scroll through my Instagram page for thoughts, pictures, and emotions.

## Hobbies

If I'm not coding I'd like to spend my time with cycling or hiking in the mountains. I then often take my camera with me to take landscape photos and also particularly enjoy editing the photos at the computer afterwards. I also enjoy learning about different cultures and interacting with people of different countires.Lastly, my love for beer has been reignited since i moved to Germany.
