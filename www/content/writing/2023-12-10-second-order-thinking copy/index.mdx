In a world often dominated by positional power and authority, the ability to influence others without the need for such trappings is a remarkable skill. 
This art of persuasion without power, often referred to as *“soft power”*, is a subtle yet transformative force that can shape thoughts, influence decisions, and drive collective action.

Unlike traditional authority, which relies on hierarchical structures and formal mandates, soft power stems from the inherent power of one’s character, 
communication, and relationships. It’s the ability to inspire others not through coercion or force, but through genuine connection, empathy, and a compelling vision. 
In this blog, I share a very interesting perspective of Advantage vs Relationship matrix, and aim to clearly demonstrate how different relationships and the advantage plays along. I learnt about this early in my career from [David Bencomo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbencomojr/).
